When creating configurations during sourceSet custom setup, Gradle found that configuration customCompileClasspath already exists with permitted usage(s):
	Consumable - this configuration can be selected by another project as a dependency
	Resolvable - this configuration can be resolved by this project to a set of files
	Declarable - this configuration can have dependencies added to it
Yet Gradle expected to create it with the usage(s):
	Resolvable - this configuration can be resolved by this project to a set of files
Gradle will mutate the usage of this configuration to match the expected usage. This may cause unexpected behavior. Creating configurations with reserved names has been deprecated. This is scheduled to be removed in Gradle 9.0. Create sourceSets prior to creating or accessing the configurations associated with them. For more information, please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/0.0.0/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:implicitly_reserved_configuration_names in the Gradle documentation.
